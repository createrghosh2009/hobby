        <p> My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my homework. I am 12 years old and read in class 7th standard. Now I know very well that reading is very good habit which can make me a complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and importantly a successful person in the life. </p>
